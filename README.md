# ModellingDERAggregators
For my honours thesis at the Australian National University, I developed this fairly rudimentary model and associated tools, the aim of which was to allow modelling of competitive behaviour between DER aggregators, particularly when there is competition for network capacity on a feeder with high DER-penetration.

PAO and Pyomo are used to model a radial feeder (using the IEEE 69-bus test feeder). 
IBM Cplex was used to solve all models. 
Performance is pretty poor.

###Usage
The purpose of hosting it here is largely to allow opportunities for academic review. It is not in a state where I would consider it to be a tool or repository ready for broad use.
However, if you do happen to use or adapt any of my work, please credit me, or at a minimum, let me know what you're doing with it - it would be cool to know.
